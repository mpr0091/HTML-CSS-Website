			<h1>Biography</h1>
			<br>
			<p>
			Charles Frederick Goldie OBE (1870–1947) was a New Zealand artist, best known for his portrayal of Māori dignitaries.
			<br>
			<br>
			Goldie was born in Auckland on 20 October 1870 to David Goldie, Mayor of Auckland, and Maria Partington, an amateur artist who encouraged his artistic ability as he grew up. 
			<br>
			<br>
			While still at school he won several prizes from the Auckland Society of Arts and the New Zealand Art Students' Association. He travelled to Paris to study at the famous Académie Julian in his early 20s where he recieved a strong grounding in traditional, formal drawing and painting. After returning to New Zealand in 1898, he collaborated with Luis J. Steele on the famous painting The Arrival of the Māoris in New Zealand. From 1901 he made field trips to meet, sketch and photograph Māori people in their own locations, and he also paid Māori visitors to Auckland to sit for him. Most of these were chiefs visiting the Native Land Court.
			<br>
			<br>
			By far the majority of Goldie's subjects were elderly, tattooed Māori of considerable standing in their own society. Goldie thought of his work as picuturing his subjects for posterity, as he beleived Maori to be a dying race and culture.
			<br>
			<br>
			Goldie's health eventually deteriorated through a combination of lead poisoning (from the lead white used to prepare his canvases) and alcoholism. He continued painting until his death, often from paintings as many of his favorite subjects had died.
			<br>
			<br>
			Goldie died on 11 July 1947 aged seventy seven.
